# Terraform Infrastructure as Code (IaC) Assignment

## **Overview**
This project demonstrates the use of Terraform to provision and manage infrastructure on the cloud. The architecture is designed to meet specific requirements around secure networking, scalability, and automation, with a clear documentation approach to aid deployment and maintenance.

---

## **Design Decisions**
1. **Networking**:
   - A Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) is provisioned with both public and private subnets to ensure secure communication between internal components and external services.
   - A NAT Gateway is configured to allow instances in private subnets to access the internet securely.
   - Security groups are used to manage traffic between services, ensuring only necessary communication paths are allowed.
   - VPC Peering and VPN configurations are implemented to securely connect external services to the VPC when necessary.

2. **Compute**:
   - EC2 instances are deployed in private subnets for application hosting.
   - An Auto Scaling Group (ASG) is configured to provide high availability and fault tolerance by dynamically adjusting the number of instances based on demand.
   - Load Balancers (ALB/ELB) are deployed to distribute traffic evenly and ensure fault tolerance.

3. **Database**:
   - **Amazon RDS**: Aurora PostgreSQL is used for database operations, offering scalability, high performance, and automated backups.
   - Multi-AZ deployment is enabled for RDS to ensure fault tolerance.

4. **Caching**:
   - **Elasticache Redis**: Provides in-memory caching for improved application performance by reducing database load.

5. **CI/CD**:
   - The deployment process is automated with a CI/CD pipeline that:
     - Validates the Terraform code using tools like TFLint and Checkov.
     - Deploys the infrastructure using Terraform workflows.
     - Triggers application deployment via Jenkins or GitHub Actions pipelines.
     - Includes integration with SonarQube for static code analysis, ensuring code quality and security.
     - Integrates monitoring tools like Grafana and Prometheus for system observability.

## **Deployment Steps**
### **Prerequisites**
Ensure the following tools are installed on your local machine:
- [Terraform](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/downloads) (v1.5+ recommended)
- AWS CLI (configured with appropriate credentials)
- Bash (for running scripts)
- Jenkins (optional for CI/CD pipelines setup)
- TFLint, Checkov, and SonarQube for code validation and analysis

### **Setup Steps**
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EmekaIwuagwu/alveum_assignment.git
   cd alveum-terraform-assignment
   ```

2. Initialize Terraform:
   ```bash
   terraform init
   ```

3. Plan the deployment:
   ```bash
   terraform plan
   ```

4. Apply the configuration:
   ```bash
   terraform apply
   ```

5. Run the setup script for additional configurations (If Any):
   ```bash
   bash scripts/setup.sh
   ```

6. Run the deploy script for full Deployment:
   ```bash
   bash scripts/deploy.sh
   ```

### **CI/CD Pipeline Setup**
1. **Jenkins Configuration**:
   - Install Jenkins and required plugins (e.g., Terraform, SonarQube, and GitHub integration).
   - Create a pipeline job that:
     - Pulls the repository.
     - Validates the Terraform code using TFLint.
     - Runs `terraform plan` and `terraform apply` stages.
     - Triggers application deployment.

2. **Monitoring with Grafana and Prometheus**:
   - Deploy Grafana and Prometheus using Helm charts or Terraform.
   - Configure dashboards to monitor system metrics, application performance, and infrastructure health.

3. **Code Quality with SonarQube**:
   - Integrate SonarQube into the pipeline to ensure code adheres to best practices and security standards.

---

## **Assumptions and Considerations**
1. All resources are provisioned in a single AWS region.
2. AWS credentials are configured locally before deploying the infrastructure.
3. The provided Terraform configuration assumes default CIDR ranges for networking.
4. CI/CD pipelines are configured using Jenkins, GitHub Actions, or AWS CodePipeline.
5. The repository includes a `scripts` directory with necessary bash scripts for setup and post-deployment configurations.

---

## **Future Enhancements**
- Add monitoring and alerting using Amazon CloudWatch.
- Integrate logging for all services using Amazon CloudWatch Logs.
- Implement automated backup policies for RDS and EC2 instances.
- Extend CI/CD pipelines to include automated testing frameworks.
- Enhance scalability with serverless solutions like AWS Lambda and API Gateway.
